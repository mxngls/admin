# Admin

## Motivation
While starting to work on a web shop for a current client of mine I realized that besides the shop itself a way to for the owner - the admin - to manage products and data for the site is at least as important. While there are already content management systems out there that seem to work great I think a more simple solution like this fits a a lot of different use cases for smaller businesses especially when these are focused on small niche audiences.

## Future Work
Right now the repository still mirrors the work for the current client, but if time permits I eventually intend to publish this as a library of some sort.
